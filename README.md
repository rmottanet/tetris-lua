# Tetris Love2D

Welcome to Tetris Love2D\! This project implements a classic arcade-style game where you control falling tetrominoes, aiming to clear lines by forming complete rows. This game is built using Lua and the **LÃ–VE 2D framework**, providing a simple yet functional example of Tetris mechanics.


## Requirements

To run Tetris Love2D, you need the following:

  * **Lua 5.x:** LÃ–VE 2D is built on Lua, so a compatible Lua environment is inherently part of the LÃ–VE 2D installation.
  * **LÃ–VE 2D:** A free, open-source 2D game framework that handles graphics, audio, input, and other game development necessities.


## Dependencies

Tetris Love2D depends solely on the **LÃ–VE 2D framework**. No external Lua libraries are explicitly required beyond what LÃ–VE provides.


## Usage

To run Tetris Love2D, follow these steps:

1.  **Install LÃ–VE 2D:** Download and install LÃ–VE 2D from its official website: [https://love2d.org/](https://love2d.org/)

      * For **Windows**, drag the project folder onto `love.exe`.
      * For **macOS**, drag the project folder onto the LÃ–VE application icon.
      * For **Linux**, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run: `love .`

2.  **Using an AppImage:**
    If you're using a LÃ–VE AppImage (e.g., `love-11.5.0-x86_64.AppImage`), ensure it's executable and specify its path followed by the project folder's path:

    ```bash
    ./appimage/love-11.5.0-x86_64.AppImage src/
    ```

    Replace `./appimage/love-11.5.0-x86_64.AppImage` with the actual path to your LÃ–VE AppImage if it's not in the current directory, and `src/` with the path to the `main.lua`'s containing folder if it's not in the current directory.

3.  **Run the Game:**

      * Ensure your project folder is structured as follows:
        ```text
        .
        â”œâ”€â”€ appimage/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ love-11.5.0-x86_64.AppImage
        â””â”€â”€ src/
            â””â”€â”€ main.lua
        ```
      * Execute the game using your LÃ–VE 2D installation as described above.

Enjoy playing Tetris\!
